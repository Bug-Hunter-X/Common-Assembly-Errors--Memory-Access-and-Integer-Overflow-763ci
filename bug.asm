mov eax, [ebx+4] ; This instruction assumes ebx points to a valid memory location. If ebx contains an invalid address, this will cause a segmentation fault.  

add eax, ecx ; This instruction may cause an integer overflow if the sum of eax and ecx exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in eax. 

mov dword ptr [esi], eax ; This instruction assumes esi points to a writable memory location with sufficient space to store eax. If either condition is not met, this will cause a segmentation fault or memory corruption.
